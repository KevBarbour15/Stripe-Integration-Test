*** OVERVIEW ***

This project is a basic MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application with minimal styling, focused on integrating Stripe for payment processing. It is designed as a learning exercise for implementing Stripe integration and designing a responsive database. The application allows clients to create and manage dinner events, with real-time database updates reflecting these changes.

*** Features ***

Dinner Event Creation: Clients can create dinner events, specifying details like date, time, and the number of seats available.

Real-Time Database Updates: The database is updated in real-time as events are created, modified, or deleted.

Stripe Payment Integration: Enables clients to simulate Stripe payments for attending specific dinner events.
Webhooks for Payment Updates: Utilizes Stripe's webhooks to adjust the database based on payment activities. This includes decrementing a seat count upon successful payment and incrementing it if a payment is refunded through the Stripe dashboard.
